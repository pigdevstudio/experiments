Hi!

This is my personal "repository" for game development experiments. You can think about it as my kitchen, where I try new recipes and you come to try them.

Each recipe is a downloadable file. Feel free to download, test, experiment, explore, and use them as ingredients for your own dishes.

[Join our community, here on itch!](https://pigdev.itch.io/recipes/community). There you can discuss topics, request new recipes, and talk about game design and development!

You can also join us on Discord for real time interactions.
